# Unit_3: project of creating a blog for my client 
My client is mayte Flores (who is currently an IB student ) has expressed  her worries about the accumulation of a great amount of  historical topics  that she became interested in , and  wants to preserve .However the use of a notebook has became   difficult and  disorganized since the needs to buy constantly a new ,notebook while keeping the others, costs her both money and effort , subsequently taking into consideration mayteâ€™s stance toward the privacy policies of many blog websites , and her passion to share these topics with her fellows ;I have decided to create a blog application for my client where she can preserve her privacy and maintain her choice of not sharing some personal data , along with keeping her historical topics organized and easy to find while giving her schoolmates access to them.
